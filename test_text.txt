The alpaca is a species of South American camelid mammal.
It is similar to, and often confused with, the llama.
Unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animals, but were bred specifically for their fiber.
Alpacas communicate through body language.
The most common behaviour is spitting to show dominance when they are in distress, fearful, or feel agitated.
Alpacas are often very trainable and will usually respond to reward, most commonly in the form of food.
